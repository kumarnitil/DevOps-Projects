Introduction to Computer Networking

 Sharing the resource, communication, data transfers between two or more computers

# Usage Requirement in an organisation
- Restriced Access - Access within organisation netwoek, VPN and all
- Open Access - Should be accessible to internal or external

Network Segementation is done on the basis of usage requirements, whether restriced access or open access. That is where we will bes using something called as Subnets.

Subnets: Network is divided into multiple logical segements.
We will be dividing our network into small segements.
And to divide the network into small segements we need subnets.
We will use Private Subnets for restriced access.
We will use Public Subnets for Open Access.

How all this related to computer networking can be achieved in AWS

We have a service in AWS

Service in AWS : VPC ( Virtual Private Cloud) : VPC : which is Virtual Datacentre on the Public Cloud.
VPC gives the flexibility to created your own data centre in the public cloud.

AWS VPC - Will give you the ability to create a logically isolated sections in AWS.
