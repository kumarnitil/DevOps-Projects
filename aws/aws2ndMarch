every VPC will need to have to be separately connected to the VPCs

A = B = C does not mean A can tall to C
 
Transit Gateway
Fully Managed AWS Service
Central hub

1.> Centralized Connectivity
2.> Simplied Architechture
3.> Cost Efficientcy and Scalability


Core Components of Transit Gateway

It is based on Hub and Spoke Model
Transit gateway acts as HUB
Attachments are Sppkes: Examples can be vps's, on-prem network(via VPN, Direct Connects)

TGA: Transit Gateway Attachments
Transit Gateway Route tables
Routing Decisions
Route Preparations
Inter Region Peering:

Limitation and Service Quotas

Attachment Limits: but can be increaded with AWS Support.
Route Table size: 5000 routes per TG Route table.
Inter region Peering: up to 50 inter-region peering connections with a single Transit gateway
Processing Overhead: Huge traffic flow might impact performance.

ASN: (Autonomous system number)

Pre-Propogated Routes

No-builtin Routes


Best Practices
1. Design with Limits in mind
2. Plan your ASN strategies
3. Monitor and Audit
