# Data Science Project: Synthetic Data Generation & Prediction Using NumPy and Pandas
📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a simple yet complete data science workflow using Python.
The goal is to generate synthetic data, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and build a basic prediction model using NumPy and Pandas—without relying on external machine learning libraries.

* We will see How datasets can be created programmatically using numpy.
* How to clean, preprocess, and explore data
* How to build simple prediction logic from scratch
* How NumPy and Pandas can be used for data manipulation
* Using Streamlit is an open-source Python framework used to build interactive, data-driven web applications quickly and easily—without needing any web development skills (like HTML, CSS, or JavaScript).
* Using matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.

📁 Features
