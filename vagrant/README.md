Installing Vagrant
Vagrant is a VM Automation Tool
With Vagrant there are no OS Installations
We install VM using Images called Vagrant boxes which are available in Vagrant Cloud
Any configuration of the VM we are going to manage through a file called as Vagrant File.
Vagrant commands are also there to manage the VMs
